# Keras XOR Problem

This is a simple model to solve XOR problem with using Artificial Neural Networks and Multi-layer network approach.

## Use
Run test.py to see the results.<br>
<br>
Put the inputs like:<br>
number number<br>
0 0<br>
0 1<br>
1 0<br>
1 1<br>
<br>
It works for XOR problem truth table.
